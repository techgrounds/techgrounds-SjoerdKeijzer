# ------------- exercise 1

# variable x should be the result of variable b plus variable d. However because of the quotation marks
# var d is actually a string instead of a floating number. We have to remove the quotation marks first. 
a = 'int'
b = 7
c = False
d = 18.5

# now we have an integer (b) and a float (d) we can use Python do a bit of maths. 
x = b+d
 
# we also want to know the data types of all variables a to d. 
print("type a is: ",  type(a)) 
print("type b is: ",  type(b)) 
print("type c is: ",  type(c)) 
print("type d is: ",  type(d))


# Print result x (a float number should arise)
print(x)

#------------- exercise 2
# Use the input() function to get input from the user. Store that input in a variable.
# Find out what data type the output of input() is. See if it is different for different kinds of input (numbers, words, etc.).
